&lt;p&gt;When considering life extension, many people oppose the idea, citing that they wouldn’t care to live to the age of 120, 130, 140, etc… but something which is often misunderstood is the means by which life extension manifests.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most people assume that an individual who has undergone life extension would be incredibly frail by the time they reached those ages, but this isn’t the case. Let’s dive a bit deeper into what’s going on here through an overview of one popular life extension drug, Metformin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Metformin’s original use was as a drug prescribed to diabetic patients as a means of treating their diabetes. While Metformin performs a number of functions once ingested, what makes it a popular life extension compound is its ability to simulate caloric restriction (CR) without necessitating that the individual taking the compound to be fasting, themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Caloric restriction has been shown to not only extend life, but to delay age-related diseases.

&lt;p&gt;Now, Metformin does have its side effects - such as the fact that a body that thinks its being calorically restricted will likely be unable to grow. So, if you’re trying to bulk up at the gym, Metformin will completely work against you. [list other effects]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Insofar as to how it works, [explain how it actually works in easy terms].&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking all this into account, we’re still in the early stages of truly understanding all the different ways in which Metformin affects the body. For this reason, a lot of the medical community has withheld and serious view on the compound until further research / studies have been conducted.&lt;/p&gt;

Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;jekyll serve&lt;/code&gt;, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll requires blog post files to be named according to the following format:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR-MONTH-DAY-title.MARKUP&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;YEAR&lt;/code&gt; is a four-digit number, &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MONTH&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;DAY&lt;/code&gt; are both two-digit numbers, and &lt;code class=&quot;language-plaintext highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;MARKUP&lt;/code&gt; is the file extension representing the format used in the file. After that, include the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-ruby&quot; data-lang=&quot;ruby&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;nf&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
  &lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;puts&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;Hi, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;#{&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;nb&quot;&gt;name&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;si&quot;&gt;}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s2&quot;&gt;&quot;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;k&quot;&gt;end&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;n&quot;&gt;print_hi&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;s1&quot;&gt;'Tom'&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;p&quot;&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;c1&quot;&gt;#=&amp;gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;
